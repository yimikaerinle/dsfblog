# Governance In DeFi

This article reviews the evolution of governance in DeFi protocols, security risks of associated with certain governance mechanisms and novel methods of on-chain governance.

## Introduction

With centralisation the main theme of traditional finance, DeFiâ€™s emerged as a viable alternative to the centralised financal institution building upon the peer-to-peer transactions functionality of cryptocurrencies. 

## Governance Token

Governance tokens are units that are interchangeable and serve to implement a voting mechanism among a group of participants. Through majority-voting schemes, holders can express their intentions for the development of the protocol `` {cite}`xu2022banks` ``.

## Evolution of Governance in DeFi Protocols
The evolution of governance in a number of DeFi protocols often follows a pattern with three major stages, namely; centralised team-based governance, decentralised token-based governance and centralised token-based governancne ```{cite}`stroponiati5decentralized```.  
1. Centralised Team-based Governance: Following the commencement of the DeFi protocol, the team often adopts a centralized governance framework to facilitate key decision-making processes..
2. Decentralised Token-based Governance: A gradual shift occurs from team to token based governance through the allocation of tokens to protocol users to forster decentralisation in the ecosystem.
2. Centralised Token-based Governance: 

## Centralisation & Token Distrubution

Effective token distribution strategies are of paramount importance for governance in DeFi. This is because the distribution process determines the number of individuals who can exercise control over a project, as well as the extent of their voting power. Hence, a well-planned and executed token distribution strategy is a critical aspect of the success of voting rights tokens.

## Centralisation-enabled DeFi Vunerabilities 
1. MakerDAO Vunerbaility: An execuitve contract exists in MakerDAO which uses approval voting to alter the state of the entire system via an "executive contract". With this implementation, MakerDAO governance framework is vulnerable to attacks from malicious contracts, which could steal funds locked as collateral. An attacker could gain control of the contract with the most tokens staked (MKR) and potentially access $2 billion worth of collateral locked in Maker ```{cite}`stroponiati5decentralized```. 

## Findings

 In conducting case studies, DeFi protocols analysed demonstrated a high degree of centrality ``{cite}`barbereau2022defi` ``. A combination of lending protocols, decentralised exchanges and yield aggregators were analysed to understand the governance centralisation. Another study conducted an empirical analysis of the top DeFi protocols by examining the wallet addresses and token holdings of participants and found evidence of centrality with voting power controlled by the top 5, top 100 and top 1000 addresses ``{cite}`jensen2021decentralized` ``. The protocols analysed in this study included Compound, Uniswap, Compound, Balancer and Yearn Finance. Compoound showed the highest evidence of centrality and Uniswap the least with the top 5 address for both constituting 42.1% and 12.05% respectively. Another unique approach involved the survey of users of DeFi protocols through interviews ``{cite}`ekal2022defi` ``. Voter collusion, low participation and voter apathy were identified as the main challenges in decentralised governance. In factoring the change in voting power over time, the centraliaiton of DeFI protocols increased with time with the majority token holders purchasing more tokens over a period of time ``{cite}`barbereau2022decentralised` ``.
